# Jelloboard
This is my archive of information about the Google Jamboard and my attempts to talk it down from the Mountain View

I am the proud owner of a wiped Google Jamboard, a 55" touch-screen 4k interactive device from Google, launched around 2016 in the US and elsewhere seemingly in 2017.

It has an integrated NVidia TX1 SoC running a bespoke (seemingly highly locked down) version of Android (believed to be Marshmallow).  
It also supports two HDMI inputs, can output touch signals over a micro-usb connection, and also supports DP over USB-C input too.

Because of its locked-down method, and requiring an expensive licence to activate, the powerful internal computer is nobbled which is a shame, so my intention is either to swap out the existing Android install (or find a way to expose more of the underlying Android environment), replace Android with the Nvidia L4T,  or even replace the whole board with an alternative x86 based SBC/SoC.

If you have any engineering information/background about this product, do get in touch, anonymously if required.
